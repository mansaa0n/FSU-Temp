# FSU-Temp
This project is an IOS application that displays the temperature in Celsius Degrees for any city around the world.  
The following website was used to get the weather current situation: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=\(cityEscaped!)&appid=4b5afb96e6cf4b4cb52763dc312a2db3"
This was an activity I worked on for summer 2016 research project at Fresno State.
